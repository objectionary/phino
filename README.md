This is a command-line normalizer, rewriter, and dataizer
of [𝜑-calculus](https://www.eolang.org) expressions.

First, you write a simple [𝜑-calculus](https://www.eolang.org) program
in the `hello.phi` file:

```text
Φ ↦ ⟦ φ ↦ ⟦ Δ ⤍ 68-65-6C-6C-6F ⟧, t ↦ ξ.k, k ↦ ⟦⟧ ⟧
```

## Installation

Then you can install `phino` in two ways:

Install [Cabal][cabal] first and then:

```bash
cabal update
cabal install --overwrite-policy=always phino-0.0.0.64
phino --version
```

Or download binary from the internet using [curl](https://curl.se/) or
[wget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wget):

```bash
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/phino http://phino.objectionary.com/releases/macos-15/phino-latest
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/phino
phino --version
```

Download paths are:

* Ubuntu: <http://phino.objectionary.com/releases/ubuntu-24.04/phino-latest>
* MacOS (ARM): <http://phino.objectionary.com/releases/macos-15/phino-latest>
* MacOS (Intel): <http://phino.objectionary.com/releases/macos-14-large/phino-latest>

## Build

To build `phino` from source, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:objectionary/phino.git
cd phino
```

Then, run the following command (ensure you have [Cabal][cabal] installed):

```bash
cabal build all
```

Next, run this command to install `phino` system-wide:

```bash
sudo cp "$(cabal list-bin phino)" /usr/local/bin/phino
```

Verify that `phino` is installed correctly:

```bash
$ phino --version
0.0.0.0
```

## Dataize

Then, you dataize the program:

```bash
$ phino dataize hello.phi
68-65-6C-6C-6F
```

## Rewrite

You can rewrite this expression with the help of [rules](#rule-structure)
defined in the `my-rule.yml` YAML file (here, the `!d` is a capturing group,
similar to regular expressions):

```yaml
name: My custom rule
pattern: Δ ⤍ !d
result: Δ ⤍ 62-79-65
```

Then, rewrite:

```bash
$ phino rewrite --rule=my-rule.yml hello.phi
Φ ↦ ⟦ φ ↦ ⟦ Δ ⤍ 62-79-65 ⟧, t ↦ ξ.k, k ↦ ⟦⟧ ⟧
```

If you want to use many rules, just use `--rule` as many times as you need:

```bash
phino rewrite --rule=rule1.yaml --rule=rule2.yaml ...
```

You can also use [built-in rules](resources), which are designed
to normalize expressions:

```bash
phino rewrite --normalize hello.phi
```

If no input file is provided, the 𝜑-expression is taken from `stdin`:

```bash
$ echo 'Φ ↦ ⟦ φ ↦ ⟦ Δ ⤍ 68-65-6C-6C-6F ⟧ ⟧' | phino rewrite --rule=my-rule.yml
Φ ↦ ⟦ φ ↦ ⟦ Δ ⤍ 62-79-65 ⟧ ⟧
```

You're able to pass [`XMIR`][xmir] as input. Use `--input=xmir` and `phino`
will parse given `XMIR` from file or `stdin` and convert it to `phi` AST.

```bash
phino rewrite --rule=my-rule.yaml --input=xmir file.xmir
```

Also `phino` supports 𝜑-expressions in
[ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) format and with
syntax sugar. The `rewrite` command also allows you to desugar the expression
and print it in canonical syntax:

```bash
$ echo 'Q -> [[ @ -> Q.io.stdout("hello") ]]' | phino rewrite
Φ ↦ ⟦
  φ ↦ Φ.io.stdout(
    α0 ↦ Φ.string(
      α0 ↦ Φ.bytes(
        α0 ↦ ⟦ Δ ⤍ 68-65-6C-6C-6F ⟧
      )
    )
  )
⟧
```

## Merge

You can merge several 𝜑-programs into a single one by merging their
top level formations:

```bash
$ cat bytes.phi
{⟦ bytes(data) ↦ ⟦ φ ↦ data ⟧ ⟧}
$ cat number.phi
{⟦
  number(as-bytes) ↦ ⟦
    φ ↦ as-bytes,
    plus(x) ↦ ⟦ λ ⤍ L_number_plus ⟧
  ⟧
⟧}
$ cat minus.phi
{⟦ number ↦ ⟦ minus(x) ↦ ⟦ λ ⤍ L_number_minus ⟧ ⟧ ⟧}
$ phino merge bytes.phi number.phi minus.phi --sweet
{⟦
  bytes(data) ↦ ⟦ φ ↦ data ⟧,
  number(as-bytes) ↦ ⟦
    φ ↦ as-bytes,
    plus(x) ↦ ⟦ λ ⤍ L_number_plus ⟧,
    minus(x) ↦ ⟦ λ ⤍ L_number_minus ⟧
  ⟧
⟧}
```

## Match

You can test the 𝜑-program matches against the [rule](#rule-structure)
pattern. The result output contains matched substitutions:

```bash
$ phino match --pattern='⟦ Δ ⤍ !d, !B ⟧' hello.phi
B >> ⟦ ρ ↦ ∅ ⟧
d >> 68-65-6C-6C-6F
```

## Explain

You can _explain_ rewriting rule by printing them in [LaTeX][latex] format:

```bash
$ phino explain --normalize
\begin{tabular}{rl}
\trrule{alpha}
  { [[ B_1, \tau_1 -> ?, B_2 ]] ( \tau_2 -> e ) }
  { [[ B_1, \tau_1 -> ?, B_2 ]] ( \tau_1 -> e ) }
  { if $ \indexof{ \tau_2 } = \vert B_1 \vert $ }
  { }
\trrule{copy}
  { [[ B_1, \tau -> ?, B_2 ]] ( \tau -> e_1 ) }
  { [[ B_1, \tau -> e_3, B_2 ]] }
  { if $ \isnormal{ e_1 } $ }
  { where $ e_2 \coloneqq \scopeof{ e_1 } $ and $ e_3 \coloneqq \ctx{ e_1 }{ e_2 } $ }
\trrule{dc}
  { T ( \tau -> e ) }
  { T }
  { }
  { }
...
\trrule{stop}
  { [[ B ]] . \tau }
  { T }
  { if $ \tau \notin B \;\text{and}\; @ \notin B \;\text{and}\; L \notin B $ }
  { }
\end{tabular}
```

For more details, use `phino [COMMAND] --help` option.

## Rule structure

This is BNF-like yaml rule structure. Here types ended with
apostrophe, like `Attribute'` are built types from 𝜑-program [AST](src/AST.hs)

```bnfc
Rule:
  name: String?
  pattern: String
  result: String
  when: Condition?       # predicate, works with substitutions before extension
  where: [Extension]?    # substitution extensions
  having: Condition?     # predicate, works with substitutions after extension

Condition:
  = and: [Condition]     # logical AND
  | or:  [Condition]     # logical OR
  | not: Condition       # logical NOT
  | alpha: Attribute'    # check if given attribute is alpha
  | eq:                  # compare two comparable objects
      - Comparable
      - Comparable
  | in:                  # check if attributes exist in bindings
      - Attribute'
      - Binding'
  | nf: Expression'      # returns True if given expression in normal form
                         # which means that no more other normalization rules
                         # can be applied
  | xi: Expression'      # special condition for Rcopy normalization rule to
                         # avoid infinite recursion while the condition checking
                         # returns True if there's no ξ outside of the formation
                         # in given expression.
  | matches:             # returns True if given expression after dataization
      - String           # matches to given regex
      - Expression
  | part-of:             # returns True if given expression is attached to any
      - Expression'      # attribute in ginve bindings
      - BiMeta'

Comparable:              # comparable object that may be used in 'eq' condition
  = Attribute'
  | Number
  | Expression'

Number:                  # comparable number
  = Integer              # just regular integer
  | index: Attribute'    # calculate index of alpha attribute
  | length: BiMeta'      # calculate length of bindings by given meta binding

Extension:               # substitutions extension used to introduce new meta variables
  meta: [ExtArgument]    # new introduced meta variable
  function: String       # name of the function
  args: [ExtArgument]    # arguments of the function

ExtArgument
  = Bytes'               # !d
  | Binding'             # !B
  | Expression'          # !e
  | Attribute'           # !a
```

Here's list of functions that are supported for extensions:

* `contextualize` - function of two arguments, that rewrites given expression
  depending on provided context according to the contextualization
  [rules](assets/contextualize.jpg)
* `scope` - resolves the scope for given expression. Works only with meta
  expressions denotes as `𝑒` or `!e`. The scope is nearest outer formation,
  if it's present. In all other cases the default scope is used, which is
  anonymous formation `⟦ ρ ↦ ∅ ⟧`.
* `random-tau` - creates attribute with random unique name. Accepts bindings,
  and attributes. Ensures that created attribute is not present in list of
  provided attributes and does not exist as attribute in provided bindings.
* `dataize` - dataizes given expression and returns bytes.
* `concat` - accepts bytes or dataizable expressions as arguments,
  concatenates them into single sequence and convert it to expression
  that can be pretty printed as human readable string:
  `Φ.string(Φ.bytes⟦ Δ ⤍ !d ⟧)`.
* `sed` - pattern replacer, works like unix `sed` function.
  Accepts two arguments: target expression and pattern.
  Pattern must start with `s/`, consists of three parts
  separated by `/`, for example, this pattern `s/\\s+//g`
  replaces all the spaces with empty string. To escape braces and slashes
  in pattern and replacement parts - use them with `\\`,
  e.g. `s/\\(.+\\)//g`.
* `random-string` - accepts dataizable expression or bytes as pattern.
  Replaces `%x` and `%d` formatters with random hex numbers and
  decimals accordingly. Uniqueness is guaranteed during one
  execution of `phino`.
* `size` - accepts exactly one meta binding and returns size of it and
  `Φ.number`.
* `tau` - accepts `Φ.string`, dataizes it and converts it to attribute.
  If dataized string can't be converted to attribute - an error is thrown.
* `string` - accepts `Φ.string` or `Φ.number` or attribute and converts it
  to `Φ.string`.
* `number` - accepts `Φ.string` and converts it `Φ.number`
* `sum` - accepts list of `Φ.number` or `Φ.bytes` and returns sum of them as `Φ.number`
* `join` - accepts list of bindings and returns list of joined bindings. Duplicated
  `ρ`, `Δ` and `λ` attributes are ignored, all other duplicated attributes are replaced
  with unique attributes using `random-tau` function.

## Meta variables

The `phino` supports meta variables to write 𝜑-expression patterns for
capturing attributes, bindings, etc.

This is the list of supported meta variables:

* `!a` || `𝜏` - attribute
* `!e` || `𝑒` - any expression
* `!B` || `𝐵` - list of bindings
* `!d` || `δ` - bytes in meta delta binding
* `!t` - tail after expression, sequence of applications and/or dispatches,
         must start only with dispatch
* `!F` - function name in meta lambda binding

Every meta variable may also be used with an integer index, like `!B1` or `𝜏0`.

Incorrect usage of meta variables in 𝜑-expression patterns leads to
parsing errors.
